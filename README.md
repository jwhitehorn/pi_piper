## Overview

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jwhitehorn/pi_piper.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jwhitehorn/pi_piper)

Pi Piper brings event driven programming to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. Pi Piper works with all revisions of the Raspberry Pi,
and has been tested with Ruby 1.9.3 & 2.0 under both [Raspbian "wheezy"](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads) and [Occidentalis v0.2](http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi-educational-linux-distro/occidentalis-v0-dot-2).

To get started:

If you do not already have Ruby installed, first you'll need to:

    sudo apt-get install ruby ruby1.9.1-dev libssl-dev

Despite one of the packages being titled "ruby1.9.1-dev", the above command will install Ruby 1.9.3 (as of January 2013) and the Ruby dev tools.

To install Pi Piper:

    sudo gem install pi_piper

### GPIO

The GPIO pins (or General Purpose I/O pins) are the primary "do anything" pins on the Raspberry Pi. Reading inputs from them is as simple as:

```ruby
require 'pi_piper'
include PiPiper

watch :pin => 23 do
  puts "Pin changed from #{last_value} to #{value}"
end

#Or

after :pin => 23, :goes => :high do
  puts "Button pressed"
end

PiPiper.wait
```

Your block will be called when a change to the pin's state is detected.

When using pins as input, you can use internal resistors to pull the pin
up or pull down. This is important if you use open-collector sensors
which have floating output in some states.

You can set resistors when creating a pin by passing a :pull parameter
(which can be :up, :down or :off, which is the default).

```ruby
pin = PiPiper::Pin.new(:pin => 17, :direction => :in, :pull => :up)
```

This way, the pin will always return 'on' if it is unconnected or if the
sensor has an open collector output.

You can later alter the pulling resistors using PiPiper#pull!

Additionally you can use pins as output too:

```ruby
pin = PiPiper::Pin.new(:pin => 17, :direction => :out)
pin.on
sleep 1
pin.off
```

_please note, in the above context "pin" refers to the GPIO number of the Raspberry Pi._

### SPI
Starting with version 1.2, Pi Piper offers SPI support.

```ruby
PiPiper::Spi.begin do
  puts write [0x01, 0x80, 0x00]
end
```

If you are using an operating system that supports `/dev/spidev0.0` like the [adafruit
distro][adafruit-linux] you can also write to the spi using `PiPiper::Spi.spidev_out`

```ruby
# Example writing red, green, blue to a string of WS2801 pixels
PiPiper::Spi.spidev_out([255,0,0,0,255,0,0,0,255])
```

### Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

What is it !? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation

PiPiper allows to use the hardware PWM channel of the bcm2835.

Value should be between 0 and 1, clock between 0 and 19.2MHz, mode balanced or markspace and range something greater than 0.

Supported bcm2835 pins are : 12, 13, 18, 19, 40, 41, 45, 52, 53 but only 18 is on the Rasperry Pi header.

```ruby
pwm = PiPiper::Pwm.new pin: 18 #, range: 1024, clock: 19.2.megahertz, mode: :markspace, value: 1, start: false
pwm.value= 0.5
pwm.off # works with stop
pwm.on  #Â aliased start
```

Apparently the clock is rounded to the next 2^n divider of 19.2MHz.

## Under the hood

PiPiper uses the libbcm2835 library from Mike McCauley at airspayce (distributed with Open Source Licensing GPL V2).

http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/index.html

if you want to upgrade or downgrade the library for compatibility reasons, get it and make it a shared object library:

```script
wget http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/bcm2835-1.49.tar.gz
tar zxvf bcm2835-1.49.tar.gz && cd bcm2835-1.49
./configure && make
sudo make check
sudo make install
cd src && cc -shared bcm2835.o -o libbcm2835.so
cp libbcm2835.so ~/pi_piper/lib/pi_piper
```
